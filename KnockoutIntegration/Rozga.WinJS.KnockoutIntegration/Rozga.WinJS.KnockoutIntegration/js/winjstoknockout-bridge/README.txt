WinJS to KO Bridge is a project that includes utilities that make creating WinJS apps using Knockout.JS easily. 

The project includes the following fatures:
1. AMD module support. Use a library like RequireJS to load the entire library. 
2. Bindings for WinJS controls to allow binding those properties to your KO view models.
3. A ko.observableArray IListDataAdapter to allow you to bind KO collections to WinJS ListView and FlipView objects.
4. A binding to bind a ListView's selection to your KO view model.
5. Template utilities to allow KO-style type='text/html' templates to be used with WinJS.

TODO: write unit tests for the framework.
